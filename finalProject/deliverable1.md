* Functions that SSH enables include the following:
* secure remote access to SSH-enabled network systems or devices for users, as well as automated processes
* secure and interactive file transfer sessions;
* automated and secured file transfers;
* secure issuance of commands on remote devices or systems; and
* secure management of network infrastructure components.

## Concepts i don't understand:  
 ### What is SSH tunneling?
